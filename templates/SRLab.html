        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of single image super resolution(SR) is to estimate a sharp high-resolution image from a low
            resolution input image. Traditionally, there exits two categories of image SR algorithms.
            One is to combine series of low-resolution images taken from the same scene with subpixel alignment to
            reconstruct the mutual high-resolution image. Another category falls into reconstructing the high-resolution
            image from just one singe low-resolution image with or without example database. Image super-resolution
            offers the promise to overcome some inherent limitations of low-cost imaging devices such as cell phones and
            surveillance cameras, and has been proved to be essential in medical and satellite imaging where higher
            resolution images can improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Meanwhile, image SR can enhance the utilization of
            high resolution display devices such as high-definition LCDs, and it provides a low-cost and feasible way
            to convert standard-definition TV to HDTV.

        <p>
            My experiments focused on single image super-resolution.
            I exploit the self-example recurrence across image scales to construct the low-resolution and corresponding
            high-resolution image dictionary which describes the co-occurrence between low-resolution and high-resolution
            image patches, and thus avoid large database of training images. In addition, from the standpoint of image
            statistics and compressive sensing, each high-resolution image patch can be perfectly reconstructed by the
            sparse representation of its low-resolution counterpart. In the following part, I will firstly describe the
            construction of low-resolution and high-resolution image dictionary, and then I will show how each high-resolution
            patch can be reconstructed based on this dictionary and inspiration I got from sparse representation.
            Finally, several experimental results will be demonstrated and compared to state of the art.
            Firstly, I construct a image pyramid using the imaging model with the subsampling factor of 1.25:<br>
